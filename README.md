# Phase 1 Project
Author: Dennis Muendo

## Project Overview
In this project I will use Explanatory data analysis to extract information for microsoft for them use the insights to establish a movie studio.

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

The analyis is based on these crucial factors:

1. Relation between production and profits.
2. Determining the most common genre.
3. Which genre of movies have a higher average rating?
4. Which studios are successful in terms of gross income?


### The Data

There were four data sets provided each containing different data. The data sets were:

1. Box Office Mojo.
2. IMDB.
3. The Numbers

The first dataset, bom.movie_gross.csv, has five columns comprising of movie titles, studios, financial incomes both domestic and foreign and the release year.

The second dataset, tn.movie_budgets.csv, contains information on released films, including their names, release dates, and financial data such as production budget and worldwide gross.

The third dataset, imdb.title.basics.csv, contains information on movies genres
The last dataset is imdb.title.ratings.csv, which contains average ratings and number of votes.

### Deliverables

This GitHub repository contains all the deliverables for this project:

1. A GitHub repository
2. A Jupyter Notebook
3. A non-technical presentation

###  Data Analysis

In this project I use explanatory data analysis to find the relationship between different variables. Using pandas data frames and numerous Python data visualization tools, I will undertake a complete analysis of the movie data, taking into account many elements including genre, budget, release date, and audience ratings. I'll be able to tell from this data what kinds of movies are now doing the best business.

### Conlusion

I will present the head of Microsoft's new movie studio with my recommendations which they will use as a guide to help them choose the right kinds of movies to produce. My recommendations include:

1. Focus on producing of Drama movies, Documentaries and also  Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi were the most voted genre.  Based on the analysis, we can recommend Microsoft's new movie studio to focus on producing movies in genres that are currently popular and have a good track record at the box office.
2. I would also recommend for a collaboration with successful studios may also be taken to account to increase the likelihood that the new film studio would be successful.
3. Microsoft also need to carefully manage their production and investment cost as we have seen a positive correlation between production and profits hence have focus on doing high-production cost.

### Recommendations
1. Strengthen studio collaborations - Investigate instances where studios and well-known films have worked together successfully. If you want to boost your chances of making hit movies, think about collaborating with successful studios.

2. Conduct thorough market research - To determine the tastes and interests of the audience, conduct market research. It will be easier to create material that appeals to the target audience if you understand and reasonate with them.

3. Promotion and Marketing - Allocate resources for effective promotion and marketing campaigns to generate buzz around the movies and attract a larger audience.

4. Invest in high quality content - Concentrate on producing interesting and high-quality content. The success of a film can be greatly influenced by favorable reviews and word-of-mouth advertising.
